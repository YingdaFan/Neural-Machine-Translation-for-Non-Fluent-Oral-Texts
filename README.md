# Neural-Machine-Translation-for-Non-Fluent-Oral-Texts
Proposed a method for oral translation for non-fluent texts, which includes non-fluent text synthesis methods, detection of non-fluent translation, and attention calibration tasks.

Simulated the distribution of natural oral phenomena and turned the non-fluent text into the fluent text.

The fluency detection task helps the model identify the fluency in the source language sentences.

The attention constraint mechanism can reduce the model's attention to unfluent words.

* [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) version == 1.7.1
* Python version <= 3.8.8
